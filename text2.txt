The
compiler
can
accept
several
base
standards,
such
as
c90
or
c++98,
and
GNU
dialects
of
those
standards,
such
as
gnu90
or
gnu++98.

When
a
base
standard
is
specified,
the
compiler
accepts
all
programs
following
that
standard
plus
those
using
GNU
extensions
that
do
not
contradict
it.
For
example,
-std=c90
turns
off
certain
features
of
GCC
that
are
incompatible
with
ISO
C90,
such
as
the
"asm"
and
"typeof"
keywords,
but
not
other
GNU
extensions
that
do
not
have
a
meaning
in
ISO
C90,
such
as
omitting
the
middle
term
of
a
"?:"
expression.
On
the
other
hand,
when
a
GNU
dialect
of
a
standard
is
specified,
all
features
supported
by
the
compiler
are
enabled,
even
when
those
features
change
the
meaning
of
the
base
standard.

As
a
result,
some
strict-
conforming
programs
may
be
rejected.

The
particular
standard
is
used
by
-Wpedantic
to
identify
which
features
are
GNU
extensions
given
that
version
of
the
standard.
For
example
-std=gnu90
-Wpedantic
warns
about
C++
style
//
comments,
while
-std=gnu99
-Wpedantic
does
not.
